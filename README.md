# Discord Embed Parsing
Made for personal use; but could expand docs/add features if there is interest.
Features:
- Reads any embeds sent in a discord guild (including those autogenerated by links)
- Applies a regex to a subset of embed fields and resends that embed in a specified channel if there is a match
- Matching pattern and embed contents are posted to new channel.


*Currently author-level regex customizations are designed explicitly for TweetShift content; however the code is generic and this can easily be adapted
